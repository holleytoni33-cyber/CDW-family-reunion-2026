# CDW-family-reunion-2026

This repository contains a small static site for the Cephus–Deary–White (CDW) Family Reunion (June 12–14, 2026).

The `site` branch includes an `index.html` with an embedded Google RSVP form, a tentative schedule (including a picnic at a public park, capacity 400), placeholder venue details, organizer contact information, and assets (styles and a logo). The site is prepared to be served via GitHub Pages.

Checklist before publishing/merging:
- Confirm the embedded Google Form loads and test a response.
- Update the venue name, address, and any venue-specific rules once confirmed.
- Add photos and family history to `assets/` and update the Photos section.
- Verify mobile layout and iframe sizing for the embedded form.
- Ensure no sensitive data is committed to the repository.
